## This is a Webscrapping Project

### Scraping
The script *scraping_v1.py* runs through all house announcements for the cities Zurich, Basel, Bern, Winterthur and Lucern.

Later, the collected data gets cleaned and saved in *flatfox_stage.csv*.

Finally, the cleaned data is uploaded in a database, for this project a MariaDB was chosen

### Analysis
The entire dataset was combined with additional data from other sources and some analysis was done.

The code can be found in *analysis.py*

The generated plots are saved in *plots/*.png*
