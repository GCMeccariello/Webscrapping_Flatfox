## This is a Webscrapping Project

The script *scraping_v1.py* runs through all house announcements for the cities Zurich, Basel, Bern, Winterthur and Lucern.
Later, the collected data gets cleaned and saved in *flatfox_stage.csv*
Finally, the cleaned data is uploaded in a database, for this project a MariaDB was chosen
